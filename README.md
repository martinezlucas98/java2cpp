# Documentation

## Quick Start

Simply pipe your input file into the translator executable `a.out` :

```bash
./a.out < YOUR_PATH_TO_FILE/FILE.java
```

## Compiling Lex And Yacc

Make sure you've installed flex and bison on your system. For more information read the [dependencies file.](https://github.com/martinezlucas98/java2cpp/blob/main/DEPENDENCIES.md)

If you choose to modify the lex `java2cpp.l` or yacc `java2cpp.y` files, you would need to step through the following commands in the terminal to update your file changes.

First you should run:

```bash
lex java2cpp.l
```

Second:

```bash
yacc java2cpp.y
```

Third and last:

```bash
cc y.tab.c -ly -ll
```

Then you can run java2cpp as stated on the [quick start section.](https://github.com/martinezlucas98/java2cpp/blob/main/README.md#quick-start)
